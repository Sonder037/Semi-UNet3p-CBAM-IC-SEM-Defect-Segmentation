# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in some cases (e.g. if pipenv is used to manage a containerized service where
#   the "latest version" of dependencies should always be used in production), it may be
#   better to exclude it from version control and let the container build process install
#   the latest versions.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, use your own judgment or specification of the project to
#   determine if Poetry.lock should be included.
# Poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, use your own judgment or specification of the project to
